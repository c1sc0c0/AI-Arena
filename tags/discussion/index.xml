        <description>This puzzle was taken from the ARC-AGI dataset &amp;amp; includes tests that we would expect an AGI to be able to solve easily. Recognising patterns means finding things that repeat or look similar in a group of things, like spotting shapes in the clouds or finding the same picture in a puzzle.
It&amp;rsquo;s hard for computers because they need to understand the context, deal with messy or missing information, and learn from just a few examples.</description>
